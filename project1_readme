## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!
This simple app was created with Kotlin in Android Studio. This app involved cloning a git repository, then applying changes, such as changing the profile name, bio text, and hobby section. I implemented stretch features for an extra challenge, which involved modifying the UI and profile picture.
